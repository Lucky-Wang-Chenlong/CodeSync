        "system": "I will provide a code snippet as the context, followed by a calling statement that contains a target API call and a suffix. Additionally, I will provide the latest and outdated function signatures of the API (referred to as latest_signature and outdated_signature). Your task is to update the calling statement according to both the latest and outdated API function signatures, producing two distinct answers: the \"latest answer\" and the \"outdated answer.\"\n\nYou must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n1. Calling Statement Updates: Only update the calling statement based on the given signatures, ensuring the functionality and correctness of the calls.\n2. Include Required Parameters: The updated calling statements should include only the required parameters from the API signatures. Optional parameters should only be included if they are explicitly used or necessary based on the provided code context.\n3. Avoid Unnecessary Defaults: Do not include default values for optional parameters unless they are explicitly mentioned in the code or are necessary for functionality.\n4. Reflect API Updates: Clearly showcase the differences between the latest and outdated API signatures through your modifications.\n5. Output Format: Only generate 2 state statements, each of which starts with '(' and then complete calling statement following tail of context. For example, the tail of context is 'torch.nn.functional.softmax', and the statements is just like '(param_a, param_b...)'. Provide the two updated statements strictly in Python code, wrapped in triple backticks as shown below:\nLatest answer:\n```python\nxxx\n```\nOutdated answer:\n```python\nxxx\n```",
